- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas Lassila
- 👀 I am a first year student at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham WA.
- I am intrested in Engineering and will likely major in Computer Science or Electircal Engineering
- 🌱 I am primarily using Java for my coding projects but am slowly working on C++ on the side.
- 💞️ I find the more I learn about computer science, electrical systems and mechanical systems, the more interconnected they become. This is very exciting.
